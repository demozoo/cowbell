Changelog
=========

0.3 (2016-11-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Web audio player now falls back on webkitAudioContext if AudioContext is not available (for Safari compatibility)
 * Fixed channel count initialisation for libopenmpt (for Safari compatibility)
 * Replaced Z80-emulated version of the ZX Spectrum STC player code with a native Javascript port that's about 3 times faster
 * Added build steps for Emscripten and libopenmpt to the development VM, as an optional install
 * Updated the libopenmpt backend to handle the libopenmpt.js.mem file created by newer versions of Emscripten. NOTE: As a result of this change, use of the `pathToLibOpenMPT` option is now compulsory - it is no longer valid to import libopenmpt.js directly via a `script` tag.
 * Added ZX Spectrum SQ-Tracker (.sqt) file format support
 * Updated libopenmpt to version 0.3.0-pre.2+r7430
